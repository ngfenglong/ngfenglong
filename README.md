  <summary>👤 About Me & Connect</summary>

I am passionate about the transformative power of technology, and I am always eager to explore and create with it. I believe in blending technology, creativity, and craftsmanship to solve problems and grasp new concepts each day. Outside of tech, I find balance in street dance and have a deep appreciation for rhythm, movement, and Japanese culture. I am a cat enthusiast and aspire to share my experiences and knowledge, contributing to the collective learning of the community.
